            WHAT IS A PRE-ORDER/BACKORDERED PRODUCT?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A pre-order is designed to reduce inventory waste and to manufacture
            to demand, in addition to that pre-orders may also be offered when
            products are in transit to our warehouses so we can prepare orders
            as soon as they arrive and ship them to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            A backorder is a product that has been reordered to be manufactured
            after the existing stock has sold out.

            DO YOU SHIP INTERNATIONALLY?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We ship to most countries around the world with the exception of
            limited countries based on international agreements and freight
            forwarder restrictions. If we are unable to ship to your country,
            you will be notified at checkout and your purchase will be blocked.

            HOW MUCH DOES SHIPPING COST?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Shipping costs are displayed on the checkout page and are calculated
            based on the freight forwarder’s rates and depending on weight,
            shipping method and destination.

            WILL I HAVE TO PAY TAXES/IMPORT DUTIES IN MY COUNTRY?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Depending on the service requested at checkout MrBeast.Store now
            offers DDP shipping which means your price now includes duties,
            taxes and freight. Be sure to select this service for a faster and
            more convenient purchasing experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Import duties are taxes collected on imports and some exports by a
            country's customs authorities. A good's value will usually dictate
            the import duty.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the cost of shipment for your package is included in your
            order total, you may be subject to taxes/import duties for your
            package upon arrival to your destination country.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We do everything on our end to declare customs (value, items,
            weight, material) to ensure that there is no added customs charge
            when your order arrives to your country. Most of our packages ship
            without any additional fees or charges, but each country has a
            unique customs process and occasionally random packages will be
            pulled for inspection. We cannot control if your order gets pulled
            and there are additional fees during the customs process in your
            country. We do our due diligence on our end to prevent this from
            happening, but unfortunately we are not in control of each order and
            it is up to your country's postal service how your order is handled.
            We recommend speaking with your local post office if you have any
            specific questions regarding your country's customs process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unpaid duty and tax orders will be considered abandoned and not
            liable for a refund.
